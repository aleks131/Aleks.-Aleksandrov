   - Added proper build and deploy steps
   - Added generation of `.nojekyll` file

4. **Special Files for GitHub Pages**
   - Added `.nojekyll` in the repository root
   - Added `.nojekyll` in the `out` directory

   - Created root `index.html` with proper redirects

5. **Updated Git Configuration**
   - Modified `.gitignore` to include critical files from the `out` directory
   - Committed and pushed all necessary files

## GitHub Repository Settings to Check

1. **Pages Settings**
   - Go to: Settings > Pages
   - Source should be set to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Actions Permissions**
   - Go to: Settings > Actions > General
   - Workflow permissions should be set to "Read and write permissions"

3. **Workflow Status**
   - Go to: Actions tab
   - Verify that the latest workflow run completed successfully

## Testing the Deployment

Once GitHub Actions has completed running, your site should be accessible at:
https://aleks131.github.io/Aleks.-Aleksandrov/

If you still encounter a 404 error:

1. **Verify Build Artifacts**: Check that the GitHub Actions workflow successfully built and uploaded the artifacts.
2. **Check Permissions**: Make sure your repository is public or that GitHub Pages is enabled for private repositories.
3. **Wait for Propagation**: Sometimes it can take a few minutes for changes to propagate to GitHub Pages servers.
4. **Try Alternative URLs**: Test both with and without trailing slashes and with different paths.

## Key URLs to Try

- Main URL: https://aleks131.github.io/Aleks.-Aleksandrov/
- Out Directory: https://aleks131.github.io/Aleks.-Aleksandrov/out/
- Index File: https://aleks131.github.io/Aleks.-Aleksandrov/index.html
- Out Index: https://aleks131.github.io/Aleks.-Aleksandrov/out/index.html

## If Issues Persist

Consider these options:

1. **Rename Repository**: Rename the repository to remove special characters (e.g., from "Aleks.-Aleksandrov" to "aleks-aleksandrov-portfolio").
2. **Use Custom Domain**: Add a custom domain in GitHub Pages settings.
3. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors or redirect issues in the browser console.
4. **Review GitHub Actions Logs**: Check for any errors in the deployment workflow.
